# Upgrade Summary: Next.js 15.2 and Database Integration

## Changes Made

### Next.js 15.2 Upgrade
1. Updated `package.json` to specify Next.js 15.2.0
2. Modified `next.config.js` to be compatible with Next.js 15.2:
   - Removed deprecated `serverActions` configuration
   - Kept other experimental features that are still supported

### Database Integration
1. Updated `.env` file to point to the local database named "midnighsa"
2. Created a database seeding script (`scripts/seed-database.ts`) to populate the database with:
   - Admin user
   - Site settings
3. Added a new script to `package.json` for database seeding: `db:seed`
4. Modified the build script to generate Prisma client before building: `prisma generate && next build`
5. Created a setup script (`scripts/setup.sh`) to automate:
   - Installing dependencies
   - Generating Prisma client
   - Creating the database if it doesn't exist
   - Pushing the schema to the database
   - Seeding the database with initial data
6. Created a test API route (`app/api/test-db/route.ts`) to verify database connection

### Documentation
1. Updated `README.md` with:
   - Improved setup instructions
   - Database management commands
   - Project structure overview
   - Environment variables documentation

## How to Use

1. Run the setup script to install dependencies and set up the database:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Test the database connection by visiting:
   [http://localhost:3000/api/test-db](http://localhost:3000/api/test-db)

## Next Steps

1. Verify that all existing functionality works with Next.js 15.2
2. Explore new features in Next.js 15.2 that could benefit the project
3. Consider implementing database migrations for better schema version control
4. Add more comprehensive error handling for database operations
5. Implement automated testing for database interactions
